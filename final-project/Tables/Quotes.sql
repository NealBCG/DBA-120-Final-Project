(715,'While the operation came to a successful conclusion, it generated some valuable lessons for MRCS and IFRC, which can be summarized as follows: 
 
• MRCS needs to continue with its efforts in community based disaster risk reduction, considering the significant role played by Red Cross volunteers and community volunteers in the response to Cyclone Giri. The volunteers played an important role in relaying early warnings to their communities and undertaking the assessments and emergency relief operation. Volunteers from three of the four most affected townships11 (apart from Myebon), were previously trained through the society’s ongoing community-based disaster risk management programme which is conducted with the assistance of IFRC.'),

(79,'The 2008 rains in Karamoja Region were erratic and caused uncertainty amongst the farming population. For example, in first season of 2008, Abim and Kotido districts experienced their first rains in late May 2008 while the second rains came in late August 2008. Normal rains for this area occur from March to June. This confused farmers to the extent that most of them who had seeds could not plant due to uncertainty of the weather conditions. The metrological department predicted a dry season from November 2008 to the end of February 2009. Worse still, the predicted rains could not come and are expected by mid April 2009. The Food Security and Agricultural Livelihood (FSAL) working group chaired by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the Office of the Prime Minister in charge of disasters, issued an <alert> that communities in the Karamoja Region were likely to starve due to poor harvest and late rains.'),

(248,'Summary: The African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD) regional seasonal  <forecasts> have predicted a higher than normal rainfall in some parts of West Africa including The Gambia. On 5 and 6 September 2010 torrential rain recorded 202.6mm which is 20% of total rainfall normally received by the country. The rainfall caused floods almost nationwide affecting over 25,000 people by destroying their residences, and other basic livelihoods. On 7 September 2010, the Government of the Gambia declared a State of National Disaster due to the magnitude and complexity of the floods. The preliminary results collected by the National Society in the communities that have been reached confirmed that a total of 2,711 families (17,767 people) are affected, 8,495 people displaced of which some are hosted in public structures including a nursery school. Among the affected people, 3,218 children are under five and 174 are pregnant women. One person is declared dead and seven other persons injured. A total of 40 diarrhoea cases have been detected as well as 46 fever patients in the western region. Public and family structures are affected, food stuff, clothing, and many other household materials are also been washed away by the floods. In addition to the floods emergency, 8 families of 38 people in Wellingara compounds were completely ravaged by fire. Families lost all their household materials. It would be relevant to note that 95% of Gambians are Muslims and are geared toward preparing for end of Ramadan feast locally known as �Koriteh�. In addressing this emergency, the Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) in partnership with the International Federation will be immediately distributing Non- Food Items (NFI) covering 756 to the most affected families who are with high vulnerability.

Regular information bulletins were provided by the government officials. Gustav is moving northwest at approximately 5 mph with a west-northwestward motion.  If the hurricane follows this track, it should pass between Jamaica and the south eastern coast of Cuba on 28 August.  Gustav�s maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph with higher gusts and will likely weaken as it moves over Haiti; however, it will re-strengthen as it moves away from Haiti.  Gustav is expected to produce total rain accumulations of six to twelve inches of rain over Hispaniola, eastern Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.

The onset of the dry season (January to March) is expected to worsen the situation. Overall, more than 8 million people in Ethiopia rely on food assistance in both relief and safety net programmes.

The food security situation also remains critical in Borena zone of Oromiya Region. The most affected areas in Borena zone are Teltele, Moyale and Dire districts. The failure of the last "Hagaya" rainy season and the effects of recurrent droughts have depleted household assets and the household capacity to face shocks. The availability of pasture and water remains poor and this has resulted in stress migration of the affected pastoral households.

Drought conditions in several areas, including Djibouti, southern-eastern Ethiopia and northern-eastern Kenya, are therefore likely to prolong, further exacerbating severe water and pasture shortages and food insecurity. In addition, high international fuel and cereal prices, the recent political crisis in Kenya, and the below-normal October to December 2007 rains in northern Tanzania, which resulted in lower crop output, is likely to result in reduced access to food imports by the affected countries to be able to cope with food shortages.
